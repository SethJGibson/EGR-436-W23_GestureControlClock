# EGR-436-W23 Course Project: Gesture-Controlled Alarm Clock
The source code for the Gesture-Controlled Alarm Clock, a course project for EGR 436: Embedded Systems Interface. Source code was written for the MSP432 MCU by myself and Tyler VanderWerp.

# Synopsis 
The course project for Grand Valleys EGR 436 was to design and build an embedded system of our choosing, as long as it included features such as a battery power source charged via USB or Solar power, communication to a PC or a Bluetooth-connected device via UART, and utilizing memory storage via a FLASH memory chip. All of these features would be implemented using a development board we would also be required to design and assemble ourselves. The project we selected was a simple alarm clock that could be operated via hand-gestures using a time-of-flight sensor. 

Our professor asked students not to turn in source code, as the projects presentation and overall functionality would be the main metric for its grading. While this allowed our teams to focus primarily on achieving system functionality over all else, the overall neatness of the source code was put aside as a priority during development. If given the opportunity, I would enjoy revisiting this project in the future to clean it up, so to speak.

# Completed Features

- Time and Alarm can be set by UART (Serial & BT)
- Alarm Time stored to FLASH
- Voltage ADC Readouts available
- Alarm Triggers with horrible noise
- Alarm can be turned off by button & hand wave
- Final Assembly

Special thanks to Tyler VanderWerp, the Electrical Engineer of this project. This project was the most frustrating fun I've had, and it wouldn't have been possible without you. Cheers.
